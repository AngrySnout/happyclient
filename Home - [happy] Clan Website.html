Hello anyone reading this!
</p>
<p>
In 2013 I met [happy]turtle on Sauerbraten and was impressed by his 
skill! Thus, I asked to become a member of his then one-man clan 
[happy]! since then, I have played almost exclusively as [happy]Pikachu.
 Our goal is to legitimize this clan as a place that skilled but relaxed
 players can come together and have some fun
</p>
<p>
Why join happy, not a different clan?
-There is a point in every serious fragger's career when he/she begins 
to become interested in clans. Everyone wants to be in a clan that is 
good and has like people but there are some negatives that come with 
joining established clans. For me, the thought of having another clantag
 scares me. I think that I will feel pressure to do well and I will lose
 interest if I don't improve. Happy is a clan that welcomes players who 
are skilled but are not caught up in being "the best". Our goal is to 
have fun playing Sauerbraten, whether that means kicking butt or 
admitting defeat after a good match. We are agreeable with all sorts of 
players and clans in the game and try to maintain a "happy" attitude no 
matter what!
</p>
<p>
If you think this is a clan you are interested in joining or have any 
questions, feel free to send a message in our "join" tab. We are 
recruiting players to join [happy] for the long haul to help us build 
the strong base of the clan. Right now, we are only English and French 
speakers, but we are open to all people from any language background. We
 will manage the language barrier through our enjoyment of the game :).
</p>
<p>
As of now, our three members are [happy]turtle, [happy]Babo0, and [happy]Pikachu
</p>
<br />
<p>
Happy fragging!
</p>
<p>
Pika Pika .
